<b>When your spine is aligned for maximum strength and balance,</b>

00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:05.120
<b>it has two out-curves</b>

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:06.480
<b>and two in-curves.</b>

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:11.776
<b>But ,when you see a person with their spine flexed </b>
<b>into one continuous out-curve like this.</b>

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:13.700
<b>They have lost muscle leverage</b>

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:15.872
<b>and increased compression on their spinal discs.</b>

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.580
<b>By raising your head to look forward,</b>

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:20.480
<b>and aligning your lumbar in-curve,</b>

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.016
<b>you regain leverage</b>

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.511
<b>and reduce the compression on your discs.</b>
