<b>It’s ok to have some healthy skepticism. But here’s what we know,</b>

00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:07.680
<b>if you push with your thumb up,  </b>
<b>and your wrist in a mid-range motion,</b>

00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:10.240
<b>you have better structural support in your wrist.</b>

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.616
<b>You reduce force exerted on the vulnerable thumb joint </b>
<b>if an unexpected motion were to occur. </b>

00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:20.490
<b>And finally, you have more padding to exert force </b>
<b>with your little finger side.</b>

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:23.040
<b>All of these are advantages.</b>

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:27.904
<b>So when possible, make a change; and push with the little finger side.</b>
