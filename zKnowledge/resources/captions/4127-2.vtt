00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:03.872
<b>Let's get started by putting your elbow on a table.</b>

00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:08.868
<b>Or if you dont have a table, </b>
<b>on your thigh, or in your green zone.</b>

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.288
Make sure you can see the palm of your hand

00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:16.160
and with your other hand, put two or three fingers into your palm.

00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:19.072
Trainer, please help and coach here as needed.

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:23.060
<b>Squeeze your fingers and feel the strength of your grip.</b>

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:25.503
<b>Go ahead and squeeze on more time.</b>

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:28.768
Now keep your squeezing arm in the same position,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:33.888
but let go of your fingers, 
and flex your wrist so that those fingers point back at your body.

00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:36.640
This is an end-range wrist motion.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.656
Place your fingers back into your palm,
and squeeze.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:43.648
How stong or comfortable is your grip now?
