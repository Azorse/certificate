00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:05.732
<b>The Step and Flex Re-energizer is a dynamic warm-up </b>
<b>that increases blood flow and range of motion</b>

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.440
<b>through the core muscles </b>
<b>and down to the larger muscles of the leg.  </b>

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.928
<b>It’s pretty simple. </b>
<b>Start with your feet a little more than shoulder width apart. </b>

00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:15.596
<b>Now, step forward with one leg</b>

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.912
<b>and open up your stance by turning your back foot out like this:</b>

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.984
<b>This foot position relieves stress in the knees,</b>

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:26.364
<b>and promotes better balance, </b>
<b>by allowing you to keep your feet flat on the floor. </b>

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:30.784
<b>In addition, this foot position allows </b>
<b>for better range of motion of the hips. </b>

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.816
<b>To start, avoid bending forward at the waist,</b>

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:37.792
<b>but rather, align your spinal in-curves</b>

00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:40.864
<b>and flex your knees, but no more than 90-degrees. </b>

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.190
<b>Exhale,</b>

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:46.048
<b>and stand up to return to the starting position.</b>

00:00:46.272 --> 00:00:50.464
<b>Now that we’ve covered the technical steps </b>
<b>to perform the Step and Flex Re-energizer</b>

00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:54.032
<b>let’s do a series of repetitions on both sides of the body.</b>

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:59.616
<b>Remember to go slow and steady, avoid strain and pain, </b>
<b>and remember to breathe. </b>

00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:03.072
<b>Step and flex to a count of 5,</b>

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:06.196
<b>4,</b>

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.604
<b>3,</b>

00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:12.380
<b>2, and one more</b>

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.868
<b>Relax as you stand up straight</b>

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:18.944
<b>and switch legs to re-energize the other side of your lower body.</b>

00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:23.296
<b>Remember to open up your stance </b>
<b>by turning your back foot out.</b>

00:01:23.468 --> 00:01:25.284
<b>Step and flex to a count of,</b>

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:26.864
<b>5,</b>

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:29.236
<b>4,</b>

00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:31.808
<b>3,</b>

00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:35.392
<b>2, and one more.</b>

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:36.542


00:01:37.232 --> 00:01:42.688
<b>Common questions about this re-energizer include </b>
<b>“How many repetitions?” and “How often should I do this?”</b>

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.036
<b>The answer is “We would recommend doing three sets of five </b>
<b>on both sides of the body prior to physical activity.” </b>

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:54.620
<b>However, feel free to try this re-energizer several times </b>
<b>throughout the day to increase muscular endurance</b>

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.483
<b>and wake up the cardiovascular system.</b>
