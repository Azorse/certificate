<b>Think about how busy your hands are throughout the day.</b>

00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:07.424
<b>Is it really necessary to use all five fingers when gripping or squeezing?</b>

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.240
<b>Well let’s try a demonstration to find out.</b>

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:14.080
<b>Remember, go slow and steady and avoid strain and pain.</b>

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:19.968
<b>First, put your preferred arm out in the thumb up, </b>
<b>wrist straight and fingers relaxed position.</b>

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:25.088
<b>With the other hand grasp the muscles in the middle of your forearm.</b>

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.904
<b>Relax your index finger and thumb</b>

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.488
<b>and squeeze with the middle, ring and little finger.</b>

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:33.792
<b>Go ahead and squeeze a few times.</b>

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:36.864
<b>Do you feel the muscles in your forearm working?</b>

00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:39.168
<b>Now relax your fingers</b>

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.728
<b>then grip with your index finger and thumb.</b>

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:45.056
<b>What muscles are working for you now?</b>

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:50.688
<b>This is why we get better reults for the same effort </b>
<b>just by relaxing your index finger.</b>
