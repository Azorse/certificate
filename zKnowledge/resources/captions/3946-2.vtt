<b>End-range wrist motions increase stress</b>

<b>because your tendons are compressed and rubbing</b>

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.008

<b>Mid-range is your strongest grip</b>

00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:17.651
<b>for most people,</b>

<b>an end-range bend results in a loss of up to 80 percent </b>
<b>of their grip strength.</b>
