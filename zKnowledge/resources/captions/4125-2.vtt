<b>Hi, I'm Andy DuBose. Senior </b>
<b>Consultant at Safety In Motion.</b>

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:08.600
<b>Let's experiene the range of motion in each leverage zone.</b>

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:12.444
<b>Please put your elbows in your green zone with your hands out like this.</b>

00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:14.783
<b>Trainers, please assist as needed.</b>

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:17.444
<b>Now, put your thumbs up, like this.</b>

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:23.296
<b>The distance from the little finger side, to the top of your thumb,</b>
<b>is very close to six inches. </b>

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:28.480
<b>Please reach across your body </b>
<b>and put your thumb on your lowest rib.</b>

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:31.424
<b>Now put your elbow on your little finger.</b>

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:34.792
<b>Your elbow has moved to the outer limit of your yellow zone.</b>

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.644
<b>If your elbow moves this far forward,</b>

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:42.176
<b>sideways, or back, </b>
<b>you're still operating in your yellow zone. </b>

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.536
<b>Ok, back to the outer limit of your yellow zone.</b>

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:48.384
<b>Now move your elbow out into your red zone.</b>

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.124
<b>The next step is to feel how much more work your muscles have to do</b>

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.580
<b>to lift in the red zone, compared to the yellow zone, or the green zone.</b>
