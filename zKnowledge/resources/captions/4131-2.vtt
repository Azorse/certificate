00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:04.096
<b>We recommend starting with the dynamic warm up motion</b>
<b> before you static stretch.</b>

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:08.960
<b>So, put your hands together. </b>
<b>And rotate so your fingers touch your palms.</b>

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:11.520
<b>Now do the warm-up motion 3 times.</b>

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.872
<b>And 3.</b>

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:20.824
<b>OK. Let’s stretch by slowly moving your hands farther down this time.</b>

00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:24.320
<b>And hold this static stretch position while you count to 5.</b>

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:26.112
<b>3...</b>

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:27.392
<b>4...</b>

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:28.416
<b>and 5.</b>

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:34.048
<b>Now change your hand position so the other hand is on top.  </b>
<b>And do the warm-up motion 3 times.  </b>

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:36.864
<b>2...</b>

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.876
<b>and</b>

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.879
<b>3.</b>

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:41.472
<b>Let's hold the stretch and count of 5.</b>

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:43.264
<b>3...</b>

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.288
<b>4...</b>

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.312
<b>5...</b>

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:49.540
<b>Relax. Now, bring your hands up to eye level.</b>

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.207
<b>Rotate so that your fingers touch the palms.   </b>

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:54.272
<b>And do the warm-up motion 3 times.</b>

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.552
<b>3...</b>

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:57.344
<b>2...</b>

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:02.976
<b>1. To increase your range of motion, hold this stretch and count to 5.</b>

00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:04.256
<b>2...</b>

00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:05.536
<b>3...</b>

00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:06.816
<b>4...</b>

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:08.096
<b>and 5.</b>

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:11.924
<b>Relax. Rotate your hands so that the other hand is on top.  </b>

00:01:11.997 --> 00:01:13.415
<b>Do the warm up motion.</b>

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:14.496
<b>1...</b>

00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:16.032
<b>2...</b>

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:20.384
<b>3. And do the static stretch to the count of 5.</b>

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:21.664
<b>2...</b>

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:22.944
<b>3...</b>

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:24.224
<b>4...</b>

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.248
<b>and 5.</b>

00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:29.344
<b>The next motion will stretch the muscles across the front of your chest.</b>

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:35.692
<b>This is valuable because most manual tasks cause the muscles </b>
<b>on the front of the chest </b>

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.088
<b>to get short and tight, while the muscles on the upper back </b>
<b>get too loose and stretched out.</b>

00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:43.820
<b>This can contribute to neck and back pain.</b>

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:47.719
<b>Let's start by putting our hands together behind your back,</b>

00:01:48.032 --> 00:01:50.592
<b>or again if this is uncomfortable by your side.</b>

00:01:51.932 --> 00:01:53.664
<b>Do the warm up motion first.</b>

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:55.712
<b>1...</b>

00:01:56.992 --> 00:01:57.760
<b>2...</b>

00:01:58.784 --> 00:01:59.552
<b>3.</b>

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:04.728
<b>Now stretch your shoulders and the front of your chest </b>
<b>by moving your shoulders back.</b>

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.187
<b>And let's hold the stretch.</b>

00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:07.488
<b>1...</b>

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.768
<b>2...</b>

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.048
<b>3...</b>

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:11.584
<b>4...</b>

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:12.864
<b>and 5.</b>

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:19.776
<b>Now you know how to use the Fingers To Palms Re-energizer </b>
<b>for dynamic warm-up. Or, for static stretching.</b>

00:02:20.032 --> 00:02:26.176
<b>And remember, use dynamic warm-up before activity.  </b>
<b>And use static stretching after activity.</b>
