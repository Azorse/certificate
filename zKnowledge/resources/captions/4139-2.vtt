<b>As always remember to go slow and steady </b>
<b>and avoid any strain and pain.</b>

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.496
<b>If you’re currently having back pain you are certainly welcome to watch rather than to participate.</b>

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:15.104
<b>Let’s start with our legs straight </b>
<b>and our hands on the front of our thighs.</b>

00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:21.248
<b>Now look down at your feet and slowly bend forward </b>
<b>keeping your legs straight. But don’t bend too far.</b>

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:24.064
<b>Can you feel the strain in your spine?</b>

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.648
<b>Now imagine lifting something with your back in this position.</b>

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.256
<b>For better spinal alignment let’s start by flexing your knees,</b>

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:33.792
<b>lifting your head,</b>

00:00:34.048 --> 00:00:36.608
<b>pushing your chest and tailbone out.</b>

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.960
<b>Do you feel how the in-curve in your low back has been restored?</b>

00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:43.555
<b>You can exhale now and stand up at a moderate pace.</b>
