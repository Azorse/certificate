<b>The first physical technique for lifting</b>

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.120
<b>is reaching with your Same Side Hand and Foot.</b>

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:07.168
<b>This applies when lifting large,</b>

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.192
<b>medium,</b>

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:09.728
<b>or small items.</b>

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.848
<b>Many people are surprised that lifting a small item </b>
<b>can result in strain on your back.</b>

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.152
<b>It’s not the weight of the object.</b>

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:21.248
<b>It’s the weight of your upper body </b>
<b>combined with poor leverage and balance.</b>

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.484
<b>But, when you reach with your Same Side Hand and Foot,</b>

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:26.624
<b>and put your big toe close to the object,</b>

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:28.416
<b>you have better balance,</b>

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:29.696
<b>better leverage,</b>

00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:31.744
<b>and your legs do more of the work.</b>

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:34.304
<b>When reaching for items with a handle,</b>

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.584
<b>for example luggage,</b>

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.608
<b>a tool box,</b>

00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:37.632
<b>or bags,</b> 

00:00:38.144 --> 00:00:40.192
<b>reach with your Same Side Hand and Foot,</b>

00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:42.499
<b>put your little toe close to the load.</b>
