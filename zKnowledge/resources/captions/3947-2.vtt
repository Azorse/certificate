<b>Creating a smart setup for your work</b>

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.403
<b>is a good way
to reduce stress </b>

00:00:04.548 --> 00:00:06.084
<b>and Use Mid-range Wrist Motions.</b>

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:07.680
<b>For example, </b>

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.752
<b>repetitively reaching into boxes above shoulder height</b>

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.824
<b>can result in stress due to end-range wrist motion.</b>

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:18.056
<b>If possible, reposition the boxes so they tilt toward you.</b>

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:20.736
<b>This enables you to Use Mid-range Wrist Motions.</b>

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:22.528
<b>Here is another example.</b>

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.656
<b>It's easy to start out in a mid-range position</b>

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.760
<b>but wind up in an end-range wrist position.</b>

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.068
<b>Taking a few seconds to reposition your work</b>

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:36.585
<b>eliminates the end-range wrist motion </b>
<b>and reduces cumulative stress and fatigue.</b>
