<b>Please watch closely as I model this because </b>
<b>when you try it you will be looking at your feet!</b>

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:10.496
<b>You will start with your legs straight and your hands on the front of your thighs.</b>

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:16.144
<b>Next you’ll look down at your feet and slowly bend forward keeping your legs straight.</b>

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:18.176
<b>But don’t reach lower than your knees.</b>

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:20.992
<b>To improve your spinal alignment</b>

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:23.296
<b>you will start by flexing your knees,</b>

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:26.880
<b>looking forward,</b>
<b>and pushing your chest and tailbone out.</b>

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.488
<b>Finally, you can exhale and stand up at a moderate pace.</b>
