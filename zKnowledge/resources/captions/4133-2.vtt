<b>Please follow along.</b>

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:06.368
<b>Again, let's start with our feet shoulder-width apart.</b>

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:11.296
<b>Now take a step forward with yor left foot, </b>
<b>as if you were pushing somethign heavy.</b>

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.656
<b>Slowly, lean forward over your left foot.</b>

00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:18.336
<b>Feel how you can flex your knees so both feet are flat on the floor?</b>

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:20.792
<b>This maximizes your balance.</b>

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:25.558
<b>Now slowly move your upper body back, over your right foot,</b>
<b>as if you were pulling something heavy.</b>

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.736
<b>Make sure your upper body is still leaning slightly forward.</b>

00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:31.324
<b>Trainers please coach here as needed.</b>

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:35.087
<b>Continue to move your upper body forward, and back,</b>

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:37.348
<b>and notice how your legs work efficently,</b>

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.401
<b>and your balance is strong when your upper body is over </b>
<b>your line of strength and balance.</b>
