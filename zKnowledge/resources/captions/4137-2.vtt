<b>Our physical condition changes from one day to the next.</b>

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:05.376
<b>For example,</b>

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:07.680
<b>have you ever woken up with a stiff neck?</b>

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:11.264
<b>And some times your condition changes in the same day.</b>

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.568
<b>Maybe you started the day feeling fine</b>

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:16.384
<b>and ended the day with a bad cold or headache?</b>

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:18.688
<b>Before you start lifting,</b>

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:20.480
<b>do a quick self assessment.</b>

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.784
<b>Do you have any pain or injuries</b>

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.808
<b>in your arms,</b>

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.832
<b>your neck?</b>

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:25.856
<b>your back,</b>

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:27.904
<b>or legs that’s bothering you?</b>

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:29.952
<b>Do you feel fatigued or ill?</b>

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.280
<b>Try to work within your limits and use good judgment.</b>

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:35.697
<b>No one gets a prize for hurting themselves.</b>
