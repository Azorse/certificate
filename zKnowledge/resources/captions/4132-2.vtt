<b>For this demo let’s start by standing with your feet shoulder width apart.</b>

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:06.400
<b>Slowly</b>

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:09.728
<b>lean forward over your line of weakness</b>
<b>like you were pushing something.</b>

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:15.616
<b>As your upper body moves forward
you should feel your leg muscles lock up as your heels start to rise off the floor.</b>

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:18.944
<b>This is a sign that your upper body is over your line of weakness.</b>

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:21.760
<b>OK. Let’s return to the starting position.</b>

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.880
<b>Now slowly lean back over your line of weakness as if you were pulling something. </b>

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:31.744
<b>Do you feel how your toes start to rise and your hips shift forward to keep your balance?</b>

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.328
<b>This can cause compression on your low back, so let’s stand up.</b>
