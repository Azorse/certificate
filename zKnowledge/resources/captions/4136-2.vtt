<b>Let’s do this together.</b>

00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:05.632
<b>For this demonstration, again we’ll need to stand.</b>

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.240
<b>OK, start by positioning your feet shoulder width apart,</b>

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.080
<b>knees slightly flexed, </b>
<b>and your elbows in your yellow zone. </b>

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:20.224
<b>Now we are going to turn to the right here; as if we were reaching for something,</b>
<b> and then slowly bend forward, but don’t bend too far.</b>

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.296
<b>I’ll bet you can feel the stress developing in your knee and your back?</b>

00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:30.208
<b>So, let’s lift the toes of your right foot, and pivot so that those toes are pointing </b>
<b>in the direction you are reaching. Is some of the strain reduced?</b>

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:31.488
<b>Good. </b>

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:35.840
<b>Lift the heel of your left foot and pivot </b>
<b>so those toes also face the direction you are reaching.</b>

00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:38.400
<b>Is the stress reduced even more?</b>

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:41.472
<b>Now, let’s flex our knees slightly, stand up,</b>

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.911
<b>make yourself comfortable.</b>
