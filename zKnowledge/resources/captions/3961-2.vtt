<b>can result in a very stressful twist and bend.</b>

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:07.696
<b>The easy way to Point Your Toe and Go</b>

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.728
<b>is to pre-position one foot back.</b>

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.056

00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:15.872
<b>Making this simple change reduces twisting,</b>

00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:18.176
<b>and improves leg strength and balance.</b>

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.504
<b>And, it is very efficient to continue unloading or stacking</b>

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.332
<b>with your feet in this position.</b>
