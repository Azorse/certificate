<b>In the green zone the muscles on either side of your elbow joint are doing most of the work.</b>

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:09.216
<b>These muscles have a straight connection from your upper arm to your lower arm.</b>

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:11.008
<b>This provides good leverage </b>

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:13.056
<b>and makes them very efficient for lifting.</b>

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.260
<b>As your elbow moves to the yellow zone, 
your shoulder starts to do more of the work.</b>

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:20.736
<b>These muscles do not have a straight connection</b>

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:22.528
<b>They're wrapped around your shoulder.</b>

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:24.832
<b>This makes these muscles work harder, </b>

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:28.672
<b>and explains why many people experience
 shoulder pain and fatigue.</b>

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.000
<b>As your elbows move into your far red zone, </b>

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:34.560
<b>the strain moves to the joints of your low back.</b>

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:37.376
<b>Some of these muscles have very poor leverage.</b>

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:40.192
<b>In fact, in the very far red zone,</b>

00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:41.728
<b>lifting a 10 pound object</b>

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.740
<b>can result in up to 500 pounds of force
 on your low back.</b>
